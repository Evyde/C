stcflash
========

A command line programmer for STC 8051 microcontroller.

The programmer software provided by [STC](http://www.stcmcu.com/) for
their 8051-compatible microcontrollers (MCUs) only runs on Microsoft
Windows.  For developers who are more used to other operating systems,
this project, named *stcflash*, provides a more convenient way to
download program to STC 8051 microcontroller across different
platforms.  Other than its portability, stcflash also has the
advantage of employing a simple command line interface, so integrating
it in a development toolchain is fairly easy.

Installation
------------

[Python](http://www.python.org) (>=2.6) and its serial port extension
model [pySerial](http://pyserial.sf.net/) are required to run
stcflash.  Python is most likely pre-installed if you are using a
mainstream Linux distribution.  Module pySerial, on the other hand,
might need to be installed manually.  For example, on Ubuntu, you must
install package python-serial (or python3-serial for Python 3) to get
pySerial.  For operating system without a package management system
like Windows, please refer pySerial's installation manual for further
assistance.

How to use
----------

To read model information from the target microcontroller, simply run
stcflash without giving any parameter.

```
$ python stcflash.py
Connect to /dev/ttyUSB0 at baudrate 2400
Detecting target... done
 FOSC: 11.955MHz
 Model: STC89C52RC (ver4.3C) 
 ROM: 8KB
```

Please note that, just like using the official STC programmer, once
the "Detecting target..." prompt is shown, you need to turn off and on
the microcontroller to enable the in-system programming (ISP) routine,
otherwise, stcflash cannot connect to the target.

If the microcontroller does not hook up to the first USB-to-serial
port, You can use `--port` to specify a different serial port.  It is
also possible to specify a different initial baudrate using
`--lowbaud` option, although this should not be necessary in most
cases.  The following is an example.

```
$ python stcflash.py --port /dev/ttyUSB1 --lowbaud 1200
Connect to /dev/ttyUSB1 at baudrate 1200
Detecting target...
```

To download program into the target, the compiled code must be in
binary format (.bin), as it is the only format that stcflash supports.
If you want to program an Intel HEX file (.ihx or .hex), it needs to
be converted to binary format first.  On a Linux system, this can be
done using objcopy or makebin, which comes with the open source MCS-51
compiler sdcc.

```
$ objcopy -Iihex -Obinary program.hex program.bin
```

Then you can program the .bin file using the following command,

```
$ python stcflash.py program.bin
Connect to /dev/ttyUSB0 at baudrate 2400
Detecting target... done
 FOSC: 11.955MHz
 Model: STC89C52RC (ver4.3C) 
 ROM: 8KB
Baudrate: 38400
Erasing target... done
Size of the binary: 917
Programming: #################### done
```

For now, stcflash can program the following series and their low
voltage variants.

> STC89C5xRC, STC89C5xRD+, STC90C5xRC, STC10Fxx, STC11Fxx,
> STC12Cx052x, STC12C52xx, STC12C56xx, STC12C5Axx

If stcflash is unable to detect the microcontroller, specifying the
programming protocol using `--protocol` option might solve the
problem.  For example, if a microcontroller uses the same programming
protocol as STC89C5xRC series, then you can program it as follows,

```
$ python stcflash.py --protocol 89 program.bin
```

If its protocol is compatible with STC12C5Axx series, then use the
following command instead,

```
$ python stcflash.py --protocol 12 program.bin
```

If its protocol is compatible with STC12Cx052x series, then use the
following command instead,

```
$ python stcflash.py --protocol 12Cx052 program.bin
```

Before connecting to a microcontroller using one of the ISP protocols,
stcflash can send a magic word first at a given baudrate to ask the
microcontroller to enter ISP mode without user switching its power off
and on.  Of course, the user program on the microcontroller must be
able to reboot itself to the ISP section upon receiving the magic word
to make this scheme work.  The following is an example,

```
$ python stcflash.py --aispbaud 2400 --aispmagic 6af23Qtr program.bin
```

Troubleshooting
---------------

Use `--verbose` or `--debug` to get more or MOAR runtime information.
